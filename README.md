# GroupApp (Flutter + Firebase)

GroupApp is a Flutter app for student groups/clubs with authentication, group chat, direct messages, calendar events, club discovery, personalized recommendations, and AI support chat.

## Current Status

This README reflects the current implementation in this repository.

## Core Features

- Firebase email/password authentication (login + register)
- Auth-gated routing (`AuthPage` when signed out, `HomePage` when signed in)
- Group chat system
- Create group with:
  - public/private mode
  - who-can-post setting (all/admins)
  - theme color + icon
  - overview text
  - banner image
  - keyword tags
- Join groups by 6-character join code
- Join public groups directly from Discover/Search
- Admin controls in group settings:
  - edit visibility/posting permissions/theme
  - manage admins
  - edit group keywords
- Direct messages between users
- Group calendar events + home calendar aggregation/filtering
- Notifications panel on Home (latest group + DM activity)
- Discover page with demo clubs + live Firestore clubs
- Search page with keyword-aware matching and ranking
- Recommendation system:
  - user interest preferences are stored
  - clubs with matching keywords are ranked first
  - cards display why recommended (matched keyword chip)
- User Settings:
  - profile picture upload
  - first/last name editing
  - dark mode toggle
  - AI support entry
  - edit interest preferences
- First-run interests onboarding popup after sign-in
- AI support chat service with 3 backend modes:
  - direct Gemini API (demo)
  - Cloud Function (`supportChat`)
  - local scripted fallback

## Interests and Club Keywords

- User interests are saved in `users/{uid}`:
  - `interests: List<String>`
  - `interestsOnboardingSeen: bool`
- Group keywords are saved in `groups/{groupId}`:
  - `keywords: List<String>`
- Search and recommendations use these fields to personalize ordering.

## Dependencies (from `pubspec.yaml`)

- `firebase_core`
- `firebase_auth`
- `cloud_firestore`
- `firebase_storage`
- `cloud_functions`
- `table_calendar`
- `image_picker`
- `cached_network_image`
- `google_fonts`
- `http`

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

2. Configure Firebase (already scaffolded in repo):
- Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
- iOS/macOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist`
- Generated options: `lib/firebase_options.dart`

3. Run:

```bash
flutter run
```

## AI Key Setup (Direct Gemini Demo Mode)

If `AiService.backend` is set to direct Gemini mode, create:

- `lib/services/ai_secrets.dart`

With:

```dart
const String geminiApiKey = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE';
```

Notes:
- `lib/services/ai_secrets.dart` is gitignored.
- `lib/services/ai_secrets.example.dart` is the template.

## Data Notes

- Firestore collections used:
  - `users`
  - `groups`
  - `directMessages`
- Group subcollections:
  - `messages`
  - `events`
- Storage paths used:
  - `profile_pictures/`
  - `group_banners/`
  - `chat_images/`

## Known Development Notes

- After major widget refactors, prefer full restart over hot reload if emulator shows stale widget lookup errors.
- Some UI behavior is demo-seeded (for example demo clubs and example notifications).
